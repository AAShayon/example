# Secure Weather App - QA Testing Instructions

## Overview

This document provides instructions for QA engineers to test the Secure Weather Forecast App. The app implements multiple security layers to protect against reverse engineering and unauthorized access.

## Quick Start for QA

### 1. Debug Build (For Initial Testing)

To quickly test the app functionality:

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run in debug mode
flutter run
```

In debug mode:
- The app will use a fallback API key for testing
- Some security checks are relaxed for easier testing
- You should be able to search for weather data

### 2. Release Build (For Security Testing)

To test the full security implementation:

```bash
# Build release APK with security features
flutter build apk --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=./debug-info

# Install on device
flutter install
```

In release mode:
- All security features are active
- API key is stored in secure platform storage
- Code is obfuscated
- Full security checks are enabled

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality

1. Launch the app
2. Enter a city name (e.g., "London")
3. Tap "Search"
4. Verify that weather data is displayed

Expected result: Weather forecast should be shown for the entered location

### Scenario 2: Security Features

1. Launch the release build
2. Verify the app doesn't crash on startup
3. Enter a city name and search
4. Verify data is displayed correctly

Expected result: App functions normally with all security features enabled

### Scenario 3: Error Handling

1. Enter an invalid city name
2. Tap "Search"
3. Verify appropriate error message is shown

Expected result: User-friendly error message without exposing sensitive information

### Scenario 4: Network Issues

1. Turn off Wi-Fi/data
2. Try to search for a location
3. Verify appropriate error handling

Expected result: App handles network errors gracefully

## Security Testing

### What to Verify

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - API key is not visible in the source code
   - API key is not in the APK/IPA file
   - API key is stored securely in platform storage

2. **Code Obfuscation**:
   - Method and class names are obfuscated
   - Code is difficult to understand when decompiled

3. **Network Security**:
   - All requests use HTTPS
   - Security headers are present
   - API key is not in URLs or request bodies

4. **Platform Storage**:
   - Android: Data is stored in EncryptedSharedPreferences
   - iOS: Data is stored in Keychain Services

### Tools for Security Testing

1. **APK Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Extract and analyze APK
   apktool d app-release.apk
   grep -r "api" .
   ```

2. **Memory Analysis**:
   - Use memory dumping tools to check for sensitive data

3. **Network Analysis**:
   - Use proxy tools like Burp Suite to monitor traffic

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch weather data" Error

Possible causes:
1. No internet connection
2. Invalid API key
3. Network restrictions

Solutions:
1. Verify internet connectivity
2. Check if the app can access the API endpoint
3. For release builds, verify the API key is properly stored

### Issue 2: App Crashes on Startup

Possible causes:
1. Missing permissions
2. Security checks failing
3. Platform channel issues

Solutions:
1. Check Android/iOS logs for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
3. Ensure the device meets minimum requirements

## Release Build Verification
